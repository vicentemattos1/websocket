## Hi, this is a small project to use as base to run the socket.io lib

## To run this project you need to run "npm install" and then "npm start" in the server folder

## After run the server, the React side need to run "npm install" and then "npm run dev"

## I also used the Vite to replace the usual webpack, the reason to do that is the Vite has a better performance.
